# User Flow Improvements: Smart Try-Before-Login Experience

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Before these improvements, the user experience was confusing:
- ❌ New users didn't know where to try the platform
- ❌ Existing users accidentally created guest sessions
- ❌ No clear distinction between "try" and "login" flows
- ❌ Poor conversion from trial to registration

## ✨ Solution: Smart Entry Points & Contextual Navigation

### 🏠 **Enhanced Landing Page**

**Primary CTA:** "Try it Free - No Signup Required" → `/dashboard`
- Clear, compelling call-to-action
- Emphasizes no commitment required
- Direct path to value demonstration

**Secondary CTA:** "I Have an Account" → `/sign-in`
- Distinct from trial button
- Clear for existing users
- Prevents accidental guest sessions

**Trust Indicators:**
```
✨ 2-hour trial • 🚀 No credit card • ⭐ Star on GitHub
```

#### 2. **Contextual Authentication Messages**

**Sign-In Page (with active guest session):**
```
